The hearing will likely span several days, and you can always phone-in remotely, or write a letter! It is incredibly important that you voice your support on this issue. Municipal politics is where your voice has the greatest impact in creating the change we want to see.

Anything less drastically inflates the cost of housing, or renders redevelopment in a community completely infeasible. Allowing this level of density by-right in our neighbourhoods is the bare minimum we can do to ensure our communities are not locked into a cycle of decline, or a cycle of gentrification. While it's not affordable for lower-class Calgarians, this lower price tag is easier to create non-market options with. Also, as explored by a paper published by the Calgary Drop-In Centre, easing housing competition for even upper-class Calgarians has rippling effects on affordability as cheaper housing becomes more available.</p><h2><strong>Rezoning for flexibility!</strong></h2><p>Low-scale incrementalism is appropriate everywhere, and it's only the beginning.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.strongtownscalgary.ca/media/posts/5/Pasted-image-20240522125008.png" alt="" width="1079" height="962" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.strongtownscalgary.ca/media/posts/5/responsive/Pasted-image-20240522125008-xs.png 300w, https://blog.strongtownscalgary.ca/media/posts/5/responsive/Pasted-image-20240522125008-sm.png 480w, https://blog.strongtownscalgary.ca/media/posts/5/responsive/Pasted-image-20240522125008-md.png 768w, https://blog.strongtownscalgary.ca/media/posts/5/responsive/Pasted-image-20240522125008-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.strongtownscalgary.ca/media/posts/5/responsive/Pasted-image-20240522125008-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.strongtownscalgary.ca/media/posts/5/responsive/Pasted-image-20240522125008-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>One of our friends Alex Williams said "We can handle the growth, but we cannot handle the decline" â€” Calgary is changing. Not only are communities unable to adapt for their peoples' individual needs; many communities are no longer able to support schools, reliable public transit, local businesses, or infrastructure upgrading. The C in R-CG stands for contextual. Height limits on new development encourage maximum density in redeveloping communities, and smaller, incremental changes elsewhere. This is a long-term change designed to allow communities to adapt to their own needs over time. Creating opportunities for seniors to downsize and live near family, for student rentals near post-secondary, for multi-generational redevelopment. Humans are complex, we can't plan for our communities' needs, so we need to give them the tools to enact change on their own terms.</p><p><strong>Join the conversation!
